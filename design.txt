MLBell Design
This is a raspberrypi hack project, that rings a liberty bell whenever a Phillies player hits a homerun. It hits a <garble> </garble> API to monitor games. Written mostly in Python, with some shell scripting, CRONTAB and other bits of glue.

mlbell_schedule.py:
- Take team, date parameters to determine if there is a game today for team.
- If there is a game, it creates a CRONTAB entry to monitor the game.

cron_monitor.sh:
- Shell script sets a flag in the /tmp directory, then calls mlbell_monitor.py to monitor the game. cron_monitor.sh will restart mlbell_monitor.py until it exits cleanly (and removes flag).

mlbell_monitor.py:
- Monitors a game, by pulling down the score every 15 seconds.
- If scores have changed, then it looks to see if the team being monitored hit a home run... if so it:
--- plays a WAV audio file of a ringing bell
--- fires off a servo to move the bell back and forth
--- lights an LED light to light up the bell.
